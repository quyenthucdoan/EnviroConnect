    "description": "Vietnam’s rapid development from one of the five poorest countries in the world in 1985 to one of the world’s fastest-growing economies has resulted in dramatic environmental consequences from polluted rivers, biodiversity loss, and air quality depletion. Climate and disaster risks are widely viewed as a direct threat to Vietnam’s aspiration to become a high-income economy. This is especially true in the nation’s deltas from the Red River to the Mekong. The nation is one of the most hazard-prone countries in the Asia Pacific region. With an extensive coastline stretching over 2025 miles, citizens are regularly exposed to severe storms, cyclones, typhoons, floods, landslides, and coastal erosion.",
